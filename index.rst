Welcome to the Tox Developer site!
===========================================
Tox is a secure and distributed Skype replacement.

At its heart it's a client dealing with our core library communicating on our own protocol. All communications are encrypted using the peer audited ``NaCl`` crypto library and this encryption can not be turned off.

Tox is powered by a distributed network which uses P2P connections for chats between people, unlike other Skype replacements no federated servers, centralized servers, or supernodes are used.
