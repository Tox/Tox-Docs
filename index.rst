Welcome to the Tox developer documentation!
===========================================
This is the API for Tox, a secure and decentralized messaging network.

Who should read this documentation?
-----------------------------------
This documentation is intended for **developers** who want to make
applications based on the Tox messenger core. If you just want to use
Tox, downloads of clients are available
`on the main site <https://wiki.tox.im/Binaries>`_.

With that out of the way, let's dive in!
